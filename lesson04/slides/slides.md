##class & id

With classes and ids we can target specific elements on a page, so we can manipulate it uniquely.

Remember, you can add a class or an ID to any HTML tag. By doing this, you would "override" any CSS rules applied to that particular tag.

##class & id

####IDs are unique

Usually, you add an ID to something going to be used only once in your entire HTML page. (Note: This becomes pretty important in JavaScript and dynamic programming.)

####Classes are not unique

Re-use classes all you like. If you have a CSS rule you'd like to apply to many elements, regardless of what tag it's applied to, use a class.
