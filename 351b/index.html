			<h1>PR 351b Midterm - Spring 2018</h1>
			
			<p>This midterm will be in three parts: a short answer section with a proofreading portion, a short essay, and a writing exercise. You will have the entire class period to complete your midterm.</p>
			
			<p>The first two parts will be completed in your bluebook. Please write your name on the front of your book. These first two parts will be completed without your computer. The last part will be completed on your computer and uploaded to Blackboard.</p>
			
			<h3>Part 1 - Short Answers (5 points each)</h3>
			
			<ol>
			<li>What constitutes a “well-written” article?</li>
			<li>In your opinion, what are the biggest differences between today’s teens (Generation Z) and college-age individuals like yourselves? Support your answer with characteristics from your audience segmentation data.</li>
			<li>What are some of the differences you’ve encountered between traditional news writing and feature/op-ed writing?</li>
			<li>What are the parts that make up a newsletter (print or e-newsletter)?</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<h3>Part 2 - Short Essay (25 points)</h3>
								
			<p>Select TWO age groups to compare AND contrast in an essay.  Hint: incorporate what you’ve learned about trends, beliefs, desires, buying/viewing/reading habits.  Think hard about what they do or don’t have in common.  NOTE:  you may NOT select college people or teens as your subjects.</p>
			
			<h3>Part 3 - Writing Exercise: Op-Ed Article (50 points)</h3>
			
			<p><strong><em>Read the information carefully before you start your feature!  Be sure to think about the discussions/assignments we’ve had in class about persuasive writing and audiences.</em></strong></p>
			
			<p><strong>PROMPT:</strong> Write a 1,000-word editorial for a fictitious monthly newsletter called California Parent News.  The newsletter is published quarterly by the California PTA for roughly 2 million parents of school-age children.  You may assume they represent all socio-economic groups and are ages 28-50.  <em>***You may choose either ANGRY or SARCASTIC as your tone; if you do, stick with it throughout your article.</em> </p>
			
			<p><strong>Your TOPIC is:  Protecting Your Teen From Cyberbullying</strong></p>
			
			<p>To aid you in your achieving your word count, I’ve supplied you with the following array of “facts” (roughly 300 words) that MUST be incorporated into your article.  Feel free to add as many of your own fictitious “statistics” or ideas as long as they are relevant to the topic.  They do not need to appear in this order. You may cut and paste in these statistics where they make sense for your article.</p>
			
			<p>You may download a Word doc of this entire prompt <a href="PR351b-Sp2018-midterm-oped.docx" target="_blank">here</a> to aid you in copying and pasting.</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>In a 2016 national survey, a whopping 85% of middle-school aged children (11-14) remarked that they didn’t know people could bully them on the Internet. By 2017, that number had reduced to 55%, meaning cyber bullying awareness has increased among this age group. </li>
			
			<li>Children between the ages of 12-17 spend an average of six hours per day on their cell phones and computers not related to their school work.</li>
			
			<li>Authors of a special report just distributed (January 2018) to school administrators in 166 school districts throughout the state found these alarming statistics: </li>
			
			<ul>
			<li>The California Association of Police Officers believes one in four kids have been bullied by another kid.</li>
			<li>Cyberbullying now eclipses physical or verbal bullying in most California school districts.</li>
			<li>School counselors reported that roughly 60% of their student sessions now include bullying issues.</li>
			</ul></li>
			
			<li>A leading parent magazine conducted a two-year ongoing email poll in which the majority of parents “don’t think that their teens have been bullied.”  However, only 21% report that they have actually asked their children if they have ever been bullied.</li>
			
			<li>A 2016 study by the American Academy of Pediatricians says that kids appreciate straight talk about such issues as violence, depression and personal safety but they only want general information in a group setting such as an assembly.   The same study shows that parents are uncomfortable talking about bullying even though they know it’s important.</li>
			
			<li>In another 2016 study, 98% of middle and high school teachers say they know at least one student who has been cyber bullied in the past two years.</li>
			
			<li>A stunt by Tori Locklear, the middle schooler who burnt off her own hair in a YouTube video that went viral a few years ago, is still thwarting parents’ efforts to discourage random Tweets and FB postings.  Her appearances on “ellen” and “The Today Show” made it seem cool to post stuff about yourself and to be joked about.</li>
