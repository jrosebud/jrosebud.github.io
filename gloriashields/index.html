                <p>Here is a list of examples, resources and other fun stuff from the workshop. Feel free to pass along and share. If you have questions, email <a href='ma&#105;lt&#111;&#58;%&#54;Ad&#101;l%61&#102;ue&#64;usc&#46;e%64u'>jdelaf&#117;&#101;&#64;usc&#46;&#101;du</a>.</p>

                <h3>Social Media Storytelling Examples</h3>
                <p>One big question that gets asked is "how can we repurpose content across different platforms?" An NPR station near and dear to me, WLRN in Miami, does a pretty good job with its social media engagement and storytelling and can be a great source of ideas. You can find them on <a href="https://twitter.com/wlrn" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/wlrn" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
                <p>Here are a few specific samples of their social media work:</p>
                <p><strong>Tallahassee Takeover: How public health decisions get made in Florida</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/WLRN/status/1540298382576607232" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a> - This was a thread created to promote this particular podcast episode. It walks through some of the history of the public health system in the state and intersperses still photos and audiograms with the regular thread text.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CeysO6HraMb/" target="_blank">Instagram post</a> - This is a similar promo created for Instagram using similar language to what was in the Twitter thread. For the graphics, they opted to present it as a timeline in text, and used the caption to summarize the podcast episode (with a link in bio to listen).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The one-year anniversary of the Surfside condo collapse</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/WLRN/status/1540298382576607232" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a> - A thread highlighting several main developments regarding the collapse: revisiting some of the people who were there and survived, or helped survivors; the $1 billion settlement for the families; the lasting impacts of the collapse and laws created to ensure better building safety in Florida. A great combo of straight up tweets, embeds, and linking back to previous stories written. It's a nicely crafted timeline that also has a solid narrative flow and jumps back and forth between the past and present well.</li>
                </ul>
