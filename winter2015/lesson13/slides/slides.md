Because at some point, someone's going to say "I don't want to pinch the damn screen on my phone!"

##Responsive Design

What is this responsive design business?

Think about the name itself: It's a design that responds to different screen sizes. This is a little different from what some people call adaptive design, which uses fixed widths at various screen size breakpoints. 

What we'll talk about is also sometimes referred to as **fluid design**.

---

##Why Responsive?

The use of mobile devices - phones and tablets - has risen exponentially in the last few years. It's no longer enough to just design a desktop experience for people. More and more people are consuming the internet via tiny screens, and think about how different (and harder) it can be to use a website on a smaller screen.

##How do you go responsive?

There are a few techniques used in responsive design:

* Using percentages instead of pixels
* Using ems instead of pixels for font-size
* Using media queries to determine your screen sizes


---

##How do you go responsive?

There are also many grid systems and frameworks out there that are built to be responsive. We have mentioned a few in class before:

* 960 Grid
* Extra Strength Responsive Grid
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Zurb Foundation

Before you use a grid, it's best to try and code a responsive design yourself so you understand the concept and what's going on under the hood.

##Responsive Layout

---

##Fixed Layout

*	Used up to this point

*	Relies on a container of fixed width

*	Usually 960px


<aside class="notes">

</aside>

---

##Responsive Layout

*	Different styles for different screen widths

*	Uses an elastic/fluid layout

*	Fluid

*	Sized in percentages

*	Elastic

*	Sized in ems


<aside class="notes">

</aside>

##EMS

__EM__

* Ems were originally sized based on the width of the letter "m"
* Same as percentages
* 1em=100% font-size
* In general, 1em is usually equivalent to 14 or 16 pixels of a given font. It's obviously different for different fonts. Some fonts are super tiny, while some are really large, so 1em in one font could be different in another font.

---

##EMS

Again, it helps to think of ems as kind of like percentages.

Based on parent:

Parent {font-size:16px;}

Child {font-size:2em;}

Child's font size is 32px

#Media Queries

---

##Media Queries - what should be in code?

```
@media only screen and
(max-width: xPx)
(min-width: xPx)

For iPad
(orientation: portrait)
(orientation: landscape)
```

Separate multiple clauses with "and"


<aside class="notes">

</aside>

---

##Mobile Display

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Optional: user-scalable=none


Why is this necessary?
Mobile browsers assume a fixed layout of 980px

---

##Media Queries

Standard media queries sizes:

* iPhone portrait: 320px max width
* iPhone 4/4s landscape: 480px max width
* iPhone 5 landscape: 568px max width
* iPad portrait: 768px max width
* iPad landscape: 1024px max width

931px is also a common breakpoint, as it is applicable to many Android tablets.

---

##Usage

/* float boxes into columns */

```
.box{
	float:left;
}
@media only screen and (max-width:768px){
	/*insert responsive css here
	ex: stack floated boxes
	*/
	.box{
		float:none;
	}
} 
```
