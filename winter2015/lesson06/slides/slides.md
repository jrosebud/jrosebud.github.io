#Introduction To Programming

The computer will do what you tell it to do. Assume the computer is an idiot from Mars and has to be told every detail.

##Pseudo Code

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language. It is literally like writing turn-by-turn directions for someone. 

Pseudocode is a great way to organize your thoughts and determine what you want to do with your program before you actually code it. It can save headaches and head-banging down the road because it helps you outline all the scenarios and possible outcomes (and helps you see if you've missed something).

We will talk about algorithms later.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,
If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door
This semester we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a programâ€¦

##Pseudo Code

Think of pseudo code as writing a program in plain English. Say I wanted to write a program that changed background colors on a page. The pseudo code would probably go something like this:

* get background color
* background color = #ffffff
* create buttons for four color options
* options = red, green, blue, yellow
* if press red button, then change background to red
* if press green button, then change background to green
* if press blue button, then change background to blue
* if press yellow button, then change background to yellow
* if press reset, then background goes back to white
