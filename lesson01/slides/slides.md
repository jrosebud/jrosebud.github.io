##Housekeeping

###You must have a text editor of some variety for this class!

If you don't, get Sublime Text 2 at [http://www.sublimetext.com/2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

Otherwise, use what you've always been using if you already have a text editor preference.

##Schoology

- We'll post files for class there.
- You'll turn in homework to Schoology as zip files.
- We'll post resources and links too.

- You can also find the slides at http://jrosebud.github.io

##What to Expect

(We don't bite, really.)

---

##Objectives

- You'll learn how to read HTML and CSS.
- You'll know enough about JavaScript and jQuery to at least interpret it. Maybe you can't write a JavaScript script from scratch, but you'll at least know what's going on and how to manipulate and existing scripts for your own purposes.
- You'll be able to create a nice, multi-page website.
- You'll learn the basic workflow when someone says to you "Hey, can you build a website for me?"

---

##What you **Won't** Learn

- Dynamic coding! (That means you can't build a WordPress site or content management system!)
- Back-end web development (PHP, Ruby, Python, C++, and similar languages)

##HTML Basics

##HTML vs HTML5

HTML5 is HTML with a few additions
The Doctype tells you if the page is HTML5 ready.


```<!DOCTYPE html>```
